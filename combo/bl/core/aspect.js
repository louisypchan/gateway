/**
 * joinpoint — a point in the control flow.
 *      Examples:
 *          calling a method,
 *          executing a method’s body or an exception handler,
 *          referencing an object’s attribute, and so on.
 *
 * pointcut — a query that is used to define a set of affected joinpoints. Essentially this is a logical expression that can pick out joinpoints and make sure that their context is right.
 *      Examples: it can verify that the affected object is of right type, that we are in particular control flow branch, and so on.
 *
 * advice — an additional behavior (a code) that will be applied at joinpoints.
 *      Available advice types:
 *          "before"            — runs before a joinpoint,
 *          "after"             — runs after a joinpoint was executed,
 *          "after returning"   — runs only after a normal execution of a joinpoint,
 *          "after throwing"    — runs only if during execution of a joinpoint an unhandled exception was thrown.
 *          "around"            — runs instead of a joinpoint, may call the original joinpoint.
 *
 * aspect — an entity that encapsulates related pointcuts, and advices together, and can add some attributes to advised classes.
 * refer to http://www.lazutkin.com/blog/2008/05/17/aop-aspect-javascript-dojo/
